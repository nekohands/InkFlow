# RepoWiki

Audience: AI. Authority: project contracts and evidence. Read only relevant topics.
Style: concise English facts and links; preserve conditions, exceptions, evidence,
and exact Chinese domain terms/UI text. AI maintains this Wiki and corresponding
Chinese guides in the same change. Semantic drift or information loss blocks completion.

Human documentation: [docs/](../docs/) — Chinese guides; reading order in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
Workflow profile (Chinese, operational): [docs/delivery/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md](../docs/delivery/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md).

## Current work

Active work package: 5.69 [Health-probe sample lookup fencing](work-packages/2026-10-08-health-probe-sample-fencing.md) — bound the scheduled Toc probe's source-book sample lookup without changing public contracts or schema. 5.68 [Scheduled update-scan page/fan-out fencing](work-packages/2026-10-08-update-scan-page-fencing.md), 5.67 [Source list-result budget fencing](work-packages/2026-10-08-source-list-result-budget.md), 5.66 [Discovery search budget fencing](work-packages/2026-10-08-discovery-search-budget.md), 5.65 [Rule selector execution deadline fencing](work-packages/2026-10-08-rule-selector-execution-deadline.md), and 5.64 [Crawler handler lease renewal](work-packages/2026-10-08-crawler-handler-lease-renewal.md) remain Accepted.
Last completed: scheduled update-scan page/fan-out fencing (5.68) — final candidate `f879d9c1b989ccc9d276f71713570cf0d6e83fc2` closed the delivery docs after implementation candidate `83f12e8cdc30837ed6a8309e0288829966065eaf` passed CI `37721216436`, Docker `37721216460`, and Security `37721216368`; closeout CI `37722668471`, Docker `37722668403`, and Security `37722668392` also passed.
Previous: code adapter response and regex bounds (5.61) — Accepted
Shared streaming response reads reject oversized bodies before decode/parse; Kanunu8 regex timeouts and adapter regression tests are covered by local gates and remote CI/Docker/Security GREEN at `0d7d5ce`.
Previous: entitlement actor validation (5.60) — Administrator enforcement at the Billing service boundary, stable forbidden mapping,
and no route/payload/schema/migration change. Previous: catalog query pagination and N+1 reduction (5.59) — bounded
Canonical summaries, bulk Content Policy reads, Developer catalog limit
forwarding, and no cursor API or schema change. Previous: batch lease renewal
(5.58) — `OutboxDispatcher` and
`InboxConsumerPump` renew the remaining claimed batch before each message via
`ExtendLeaseBatchAsync` (owner- and terminal-state-guarded UPDATE; default
no-op fallback is for test doubles only). Batch work slower than the lease no
longer hands messages to other instances mid-batch; a single handler outliving
its whole lease remains bounded by the idempotent consumer (CI/Docker/Security
GREEN at `1658b87`, runs 37478901744/37478902070/37478901915).

## Migration and unresolved conflicts

Adoption record (inventory map, dispositions, sync verdict):
[docs/delivery/adoption-2026-10-02.md](../docs/delivery/adoption-2026-10-02.md).
Unresolved conflicts: none. Known documented boundary (not a conflict): Reader
visibility of platform-level collection runs/packages is an accepted product
decision (5.52, ADR 0028) pending ownership fields; the 2026-09-11 review's H3
item is superseded by that record.
